# VinylViz Multiplatform Update Plan

## Executive Summary

VinylViz is evolving from a passive visionOS visualization experience to an active, AI-powered music discovery platform that spans multiple Apple platforms. The iOS version will transform music listening into an interactive journey that combines stunning audio-reactive visuals with intelligent conversation and personalized music discovery.

## Vision Statement

Create an engaging, active listening experience where users enjoy beautiful audio-reactive visualizations while having a conversation with an AI "music buddy" that learns their preferences through simple, binary-choice questions, ultimately providing deep, personalized music recommendations that go beyond mainstream suggestions.

## Platform Strategy

### Current State
- **visionOS**: Existing immersive visualization experience (maintained)

### New Development
- **iOS**: Primary focus for the active listening experience
- **tvOS**: Potential future expansion (deferred)

## Core Components

### 1. Music Identification Engine
**Technology**: ShazamKit
- Real-time audio recognition using device microphone
- Automatic song and artist identification
- Retrieval of comprehensive metadata (title, artist, artwork, genre)
- Direct Apple Music integration for seamless library access

### 2. Audio-Reactive Visualization System
**Purpose**: Provide mesmerizing visual feedback that responds to music
- Real-time audio analysis and frequency response
- Dynamic visual elements that pulse, flow, and transform with the music
- Multiple visualization modes (TBD - specific designs to be determined)
- Smooth, performant animations that enhance rather than distract from listening

### 3. AI Conversation Engine
**Technology**: OpenAI API
**Personality**: "Stoned friend with encyclopedic music knowledge"

#### Information Pop-ups
- Interesting facts about the current song, artist, or album
- Historical context and cultural significance
- Recording techniques and production trivia
- Band member stories and collaborations
- Genre evolution and influences

#### Interactive Questions
**Design Principles**:
- Always short and digestible
- Always binary choice (A or B format)
- Mix of music-specific and mood-based queries
- Progressive depth based on user engagement

**Question Types**:
- Musical element preferences ("Do you dig that fuzzy guitar tone?")
- Emotional response ("Does this track make you want to dance or chill?")
- Comparative preferences ("More Beatles or more Stones?")
- Production preferences ("Raw garage sound or polished studio magic?")

### 4. Preference Learning System
**Local Data Storage**:
- User responses to all questions
- Timestamp and song context for each response
- Building comprehensive taste profile over time

**Feedback Loop**:
- Responses fed back to OpenAI for context
- Progressively smarter questions based on accumulated knowledge
- Deeper understanding of user's musical DNA

### 5. Music Discovery Engine
**Suggestions View**:
- Separate interface from main listening view
- AI-generated recommendations based on accumulated preference data
- Deep cuts and obscure gems alongside accessible suggestions
- Recommendations formatted as JSON for Apple Music API integration

**User Actions**:
- "I already know and love this" - positive reinforcement
- "Not my thing" - negative feedback for learning
- "Add to Library" - direct Apple Music integration (if supported)
- "Play Sample" - quick preview functionality

**Discovery Depth**:
- Surface-level suggestions for new users
- Increasingly obscure and specific as preference data grows
- Example: Classic rock fan who likes fuzz guitars → rare 60s garage psych recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Audio Input** → ShazamKit → Song Identification
2. **Song Data** → OpenAI Context → Generate Questions/Facts
3. **User Responses** → Local Storage → Preference Profile
4. **Preference Profile** → OpenAI → Music Recommendations
5. **Recommendations** → Apple Music API → Playable Suggestions

### API Integrations
- **ShazamKit**: Song identification and metadata
- **OpenAI**: Conversation generation and recommendation engine
- **Apple Music/MusicKit**: Library integration and playback
- **Core Audio**: Real-time audio analysis for visualizations

## User Experience Flow

### Main Listening Mode
1. User opens app while music is playing
2. ShazamKit identifies the song automatically
3. Visualization begins reacting to audio
4. AI starts sharing interesting facts via pop-ups
5. Occasional binary-choice questions appear
6. User taps preferred option
7. Responses saved and used to refine future interactions

### Discovery Mode
1. User navigates to Suggestions view
2. AI generates personalized recommendations
3. Recommendations displayed with Apple Music integration
4. User can preview, dismiss, or add to library
5. Feedback improves future recommendations

## OpenAI Prompt Strategy

### Core Personality Traits
- Enthusiastic but laid-back
- Deeply knowledgeable without being pretentious
- Conversational and slightly irreverent
- Focuses on interesting stories over dry facts

### Information Guidelines
- Keep facts short and punchy
- Mix trivia with emotional/cultural context
- Avoid overwhelming technical details
- Focus on what makes music special to humans

### Question Generation Rules
- Maximum 10 words per question
- Always provide exactly 2 options
- Use casual, friendly language
- Balance specific and abstract questions
- Adapt complexity based on user engagement

### Recommendation Approach
- Start broad, get specific over time
- Balance familiar and challenging suggestions
- Prioritize musical journey over genre boundaries
- Surface both popular deep cuts and true obscurities
- Consider mood, energy, and context alongside genre

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
